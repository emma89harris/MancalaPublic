# Introduction

The aim of this project was to build a program that can play Mancala. The core algorithm is the minimax algorithm, with alpha-beta pruning speeding up the search. In addition, to make the application more user-friendly, there is a graphical user interface (GUI).

There are detailed documentation and comments throughout the code.

# Setting Up the Program

1. Download mancala.zip.
2. Open main.py in a code editor. There are detailed comments that provide further instructions.
3. After reading through those comments, run main.py.
